Pascal's Triangle


The triangle below is known as Pascal’s triangle.
    1
   1 1
  1 2 1
 1 3 3 1
1 4 6 4 1

In this triangle, the value at a position is equal to the sum of values of the 2 elements just above it.

Examples
The 2nd element of 5th row is 1+3 => 4
The 3rd element of 5th row is 3+3 => 6
The 4th element of 5th row is 3+1 => 4
For the leftmost and the rightmost position in each row, the value is 1. The element in the first row is also 1.

Given a number n, find the nth row of pascal’s triangle.

Testing
Input Format
The first line contains ‘T’ denoting the no. of test cases.

Next T lines contains a number 'n' denoting the row number of pascal’s triangle.

Output Format
For each test case, a line containing ‘n’ space-separated integers denoting the elements in the nth row.
